# Tic Tac Toe Game in C++

## Overview

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using C++. It allows two players to play on a 3x3 grid, taking turns to place their respective marks ('X' or 'O'). The game checks for win conditions after each move and announces the winner or if the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- **Two-Player Gameplay**: Players alternate turns to place their marks on the grid.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures players enter valid moves within the grid and prevents overwriting existing moves.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically checks for a winning condition (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or a draw after each move.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed that supports C++11 or later (e.g., g++, clang++).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mdsahidreja/tic_tac_toe.git
